# This is Pyst code
# Welcome to create a better version of yourself
# All the lines that start with '#' are comments, this is to describe the code so it is better for you to understand.


# As i have said in the description of the project we can change at any age but when we get older it just gets harder to do it, but not impossible.
# If you are trying to create a new habit one of the things that you need to know is that you are trying to rewire your brain,
# because with your current behavior all your neural network are set up for you to perform in the way you usually do.
# So change it will take a little time but will also generate that your brain start performing better because when you start doing something new your brain also generates more conections
# between the neurons, this process is called neuroplasticity. I'm not a doctor, psychologist or psychiatrist but im in the process
# to recover some years and if you are on the same path and this helps you i'm happy to share with you.
# Also important, never stop learning wink wink.
