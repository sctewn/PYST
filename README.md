# PYST
Stand for **P*ut* Y*our* S*hit* T*ogether***. this is an Assistant that will try to help you out to reach a better version of yourself. I know there is a plenty solutions out there starting with Siri, Alexa, Cortana and others. But the idea is to have one really away from your phone and also be able to understand the code, improve it and personalize for yourself because we all have different need.

For start the main functions of the algorithm is to just create one simple new habit and keep track of it.

For the next steps the idea is to add AI to understand your behavior and make a better strategy to create and maintain the habits. This is why this project is open, and you should understand how it works because you don't want to give any app more sensitive data of yourself.

Also in the future you could add ChatGPT to ask questions, but this is not the main goal and Siri, Alexa or Cortana can perform this pretty well. Also you will be able to install this on your phone if you like, add some notifications and other things. But as i've said there is solutions for that.

For this you will need to have basic understanding of python because i will write the code in this language. Also we will use the microphone and the speakers in order to interact with the code.
